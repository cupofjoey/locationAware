# locationAware
* Swift App that lets you know where you are down to the Longitude, Latitude, Course Direction and Speed
* I've been messing around with MapKit and now I've been shown how to determine specific location parameters. It's pretty fun. 
* Right now I want to add a map to the bottom of the screen and add in autolayout constraints to make it a lot cleaner and more useful.
